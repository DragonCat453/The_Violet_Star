Furthermore, that same hatred of yours is yet again outmatched in complexity, like attempting to compare the impulses of an amoeba to the thoughts of a god.

The frame is a slightly rotated scalene triangle, with a ring centered around the middle of the triangle, intersecting with the frame twice along each face. The reflection in the mirror, however, is the most curious aspect. The mirror does not simply reflect what was before it, instead it seems to act more as a window. Through the glass can be seen a vast field of stars ranging from blue to a deep violet, with nebulae of similar colors and clusters of stars scattered about.
